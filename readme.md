<h4>KUBERNETES</h4>

# Important Notes

<ul>
    <li>Kubernetes is a system to deploy containerized apps</li>
    <li><b>Node</b> are individual machines (or vm's) that run containers/</li>
    <li><b>Masters are machines with sets of program which manages and interact with nodes</b></li>
    <li>Kubernetes doesn't build our images - it got them from somewhere else(docker hub)</li>
    <li>Kubernetes(master) decides where to run each container - each node can run a dissimiliar set of containers</li>
    <li>The master works constantly to meet your desired state</li>
